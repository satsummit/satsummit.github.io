Earth Observation Foundation Models are a potential game-changer for climate and sustainable development. Distilling and synthesizing vast amounts of earth observation (EO) data is a powerful way to provide useful inputs for numerous downstream applications such as forest carbon measurement, disaster detection, or crop monitoring at a lower cost. 

This hands-on workshop will introduce participants to applying Earth Observation (EO) foundation models in their own work. Participants will practice finetuning existing EO foundation models for specific sustainability applications, such as land cover, crop harvests, or flooding. The workshop will cover foundation models such as 1) Clay, 2) IBM and NASA's watsonx.ai geospatial foundation model, and 3) potentially a model from the European Space Agency’s FAST-EO project. With support from Amazon Web Services, participants will use SageMaker notebooks to do this exploration at no cost.
