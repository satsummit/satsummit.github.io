Our decisions in the next decade will crucially influence future climate scenarios, offering us the chance to define sustainable pathways for our civilization. What is this community doing to provide the data to shape those decisions? 

Discussants will provide a vision for the decade ahead. They will frame the opportunity ahead and share their insights into how we can collectively rise to meet the challenge.
