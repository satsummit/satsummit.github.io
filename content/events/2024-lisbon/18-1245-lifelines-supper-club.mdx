Led by <Speaker name='bill-greer' />, this NASA Lifelines Supper Club will kick off a new series diving into the possibilities of a dedicated humanitarian satellite mission. We’ll explore use cases while discussing mission requirements, accessibility, and weighing the pros and cons of such a mission against our collective knowledge of the public and commercial satellite landscape.
Space is limited! If you’re interested in joining, email facilitator Seamus Geraty at seamus.geraty@nasalifelines.org.
