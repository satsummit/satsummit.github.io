Join us to improve the [STAC render extension](https://github.com/stac-extensions/render):

* discuss the potential evolution of the extension
* help integrate render in TiTiler (python)
* add tab in stac-viewer to select the rendering (javascript)
* test, play and demonstrate new rendering capabilities
