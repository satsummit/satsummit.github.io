Oceans cover over 70% of the earth’s surface and play a vital role for global food security and in regulating the earth’s climate. At the same time, marine ecosystems are among the least understood of ecosystems. The panelists of this session explore how we can leverage Earth Data to improve our understanding of these systems. What other technologies and data should we look at to overcome some of the inherent limitations of EO.
