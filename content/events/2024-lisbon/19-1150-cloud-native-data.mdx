Traditional file formats used in climate data, such as GRIB, NetCDF and GeoTIFF, have long been the backbone of Earth observation and climate research. However, as the volume and complexity of climate data continue to grow, these legacy formats face significant challenges in terms of scalability, accessibility, and processing efficiency. This session will explore how cloud-optimized geospatial formats offer a transformative opportunity for the climate science community.
