How can satellite data move the world to act on nature and climate?
The twin crises of nature and climate come together in how we manage land—no more so than through agriculture. Demand for farmland uproots natural ecosystems and creates a quarter of global carbon emissions, yet agriculture is how humanity most directly depends on nature and will suffer from climate change.

In this session we will explore how earth observation can empower society to manage land systems across scales. From governments, corporations, and financial systems, to individual farmers, satellite data is showing how we’re changing the planet, and helping us create a better future.
