AI is causing a paradigm shift in Climate and Weather modeling, with a move from numerical to data-driven approaches. This panel will explore the integration of AI into these scientific domains. How do we build trust and drive adoption of AI models? What will be the role of numerical approaches in the future? Are there lessons that apply to other scientific domains?
