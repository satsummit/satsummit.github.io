David is a data engineer at [Development Seed](https://developmentseed.org/). He has extensive experience working with, advocating for, and developing open source geospatial software and data. David believes in the right size tool for the right job, whether that is using an existing mapping service, wiring up an ETL workflow with shell scripts, or orchestrating large scalable workflows with the latest cloud based technologies. David has a particular affinity for working with temporal data and is a fanatic for working with PostgreSQL and PostGIS.

Before joining Devel
David was recognized by the Minnesota GIS/LIS Association with the Polaris Leadership Award and by MetroGIS Regional Data Sharing Collaborative with a Leadership Service Award. David was involved in the early creation of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo) where he has worked with public data initiatives as well as the organization of the Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial (FOSS4G) International and North American events, chairing the event in Minneapolis 2013. David serves on the Board of Directors of the Sahana Software Foundation, which is focused on open source solutions for disaster management.

Based in Minnesota, David spends time trail running and coaching others to run ridiculously long distances. He received a B.A. in Geology from Carleton College and an M.S. in Forestry from the University of Minnesota.
