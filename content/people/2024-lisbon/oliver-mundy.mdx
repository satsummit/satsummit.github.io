Oliver designs and evaluates rural development projects funded by the UN International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). His professional mission is to get project investments such as rural roads, irrigation schemes and rangeland interventions mapped so that we can measure their true extent and impact using GIS and EO data. Oliver has worked in Georgia, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Lesotho, Sierra Leone, Uganda and Uzbekistan. He is passionate about natural resource management, pastoralism and geospatial analysis.
Oliver worked for almost three years on pastoralism at FAO and as a research fellow at Bioversity International on agrobiodiversity and nutrition. He spent a year living and working in rural Lesotho, practising conservation agriculture, a farming method that prevents soil loss.
