Luísa Lamas is a physical oceanographer at the Instituto Hidrográfico (IH) in Lisbon, Portugal, and currently serves as the lead Data Coordinator in the Division of Oceanography. She is responsible for overseeing data management, processing, and quality control activities. Her research focuses on the synergistic use of multiplatform data—including satellite data, ocean models, and in-situ observations—to study ocean dynamics and develop high-value services and products for public use, prioritizing support for naval maritime operations. Recently, she has been the lead scientist on a Sentinel-3 Validation Team project, aimed at developing an operational service for near real-time comparison between satellite-derived sea surface temperatures and in-situ data collected by IH’s monitoring service.
