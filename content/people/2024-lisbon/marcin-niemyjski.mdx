Graduated in Geodesy and Cartography from the Warsaw University of Technology, with early academic interests in higher geodesy, gravimetry, and Earth's gravity anomalies. Over time, the focus shifted towards spatial data processing and remote sensing, leading to a specialization in Geographical Information Systems. Post-graduation, the focus was on developing skills in Big Data and cloud computing. Work at CloudFerro involves contributing to both the frontend and backend of the CDSE STAC catalog, as well as developing data streaming methods, ultimately making Copernicus data more analysis-ready.
