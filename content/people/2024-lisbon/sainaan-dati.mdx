Sainaan is a skilled Project Manager and Monitoring and Evaluation lead with extensive experience spearheading initiatives across Africa focused on policy reform, process reengineering, gender, and health. 

Currently, Sainaan is a consultant in the development practice of Dev-Afrique Development Advisors. Based in Abuja Nigeria, Sainaan works as part of the BMFG Geospatial Insight Support Team (GIST), to assess the impact of geospatial actors at the last-mile and manage the technical team to deliver advanced geospatial analytical support to the Nigeria Polio program. A journey which began with a national landscape assessment to understand the value pipeline and determine gaps at national levels, culminated in a comprehensive sub-national geospatial capacity assessment in seven polio priority states in Nigeria, to better understand the needs of end-users and identify critical gaps that hinder the effective use of geospatial tools at sub-national levels. Sainaanâ€™s team is now in the process of conducting specialized analysis, based on strong problem-solving principles and innovative ideas to provide insight using the current capacity and data available, to ultimately support decision making for programmatic impact.
