Ian is CEO of [Development Seed](https://developmentseed.org/), which builds impactful geospatial products to track and understand a changing planet. We create, analyze and share massive amounts of data; leveraging AI, cloud infrastructure, and innovative product design to analyze the earth and put insights into the pockets of decisionmakers. From our work with NASA to use AI to classify hurricanes as imagery comes off the satellite–to helping the World Bank use machine learning to rapidly map national power grids, we work for the people who work on the world’s hardest problems.
